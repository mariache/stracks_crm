Click the link to the ➡ <em>[DEPLOYED APP](https://stracks-crm.vercel.app/)</em> ⬅ to see it in action
### Overview
stracks_crm is a very simple CRM that shows the list of customers as long as the list of opportunuties;
<br/>
The API is provided and supports CRUD operations for `/customers` and `/opportunities`.

The task was to <em>fetch</em> and <em>display</em> data correctly (UI was not provided though) with all the dependancies;

### Technologies used:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/);
- [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/); 
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/);
- [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main);
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (Code formatting);
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) (Testing framework);
- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) (Analyzing code problems (AirBnB rules));
- [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (Managing state);
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) (Fetching and caching data);
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) (To run precommit hooks(in this case `yarn eslint` will be run for every commit));
- [DataGrid MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) (React data table and react data grid with sorting/filtering/pagination functionality);
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) (UI Library that provides a simple, customizable, and accessible library of React components , and speeds up the development process(in theory though));


### How to start the app:
1. clone repo with `https://github.com/mariache/stracks_crm.git`
2. run `yarn` to install all dependancies
3. run `yarn start` to start the application

### How to run ESlint and check code for errors:
1. clone repo with `https://github.com/mariache/stracks_crm.git`
2. run `yarn eslint` to analyze code for any errors 
3. run `yarn eslint-fix` to fix problems that can be auto fixed;

Initially the application is scaffolded with Vite (as it has Typescript and React and it's faster than Creact React App) and deployed on Vercel
