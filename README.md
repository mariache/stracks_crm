# stracks_crm 
### Overview
stracks_crm is a very simple CRM that shows the list of customers as long as the list of opportunuties;
<br/>
The API is provided and supports CRUD operations for `/customers` and `/opportunities`.

The task was to <em>fetch</em> and <em>display</em> data correctly (UI was not provided though) with all the dependancies;

### How to start the app:
1. clone repo with `https://github.com/mariache/stracks_crm.git`
2. run `yarn`to install all dependancies
3. run `yarn start` to start the application

Initially the application is created with Vite (as it has Typescript and React and it's faster than Creact React App)

### Technologies used:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/);
- [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/); 
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/);
- [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main);
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) (for fetching and caching data);
- [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (for managing global state);
- [DataGrid MUI](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) (react data table and react data grid with sorting/filtering/pagination functionality)
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) (UI Library that provides a simple, customizable, and accessible library of React components , and speeds up the development process(in theory though));
